* create dist

* BUG: calling tinyProgress.start(true).done(false) multiple times will break the bar
  this is because the transition is set to the fast transition but never back and somehow the transition events
  aren't called...

* TODO typescript can create umd but webpack cant consume umd's created by typescript...
  (with teh plugin we need to change to the ifs then it works so only amd is consumed by webpack)
